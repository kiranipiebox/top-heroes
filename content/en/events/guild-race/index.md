Guild Race is a 6 day event, where lords can complete tasks to earn points towards individual and guild ranking.

Each day you can buy 15 task tickets.

| Ticket | 1 | 2 and 3 | 4 and  5 | 6 to 15 | 
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| Cost in diamonds  | free | 50 each | 100 each |  300 each | 

In the task list, the first two tasks marked as "Exclusive" are individual tasks that only you can see. 
These exclusive tasks can be easier to complete than the normal tasks.

#### Tips:
  - Buy the first task of the day for free
  - If you can afford it, buy the 4 next task tickets that are cheaper (the total 4 are 300 diamonds)
  - Refresh exclusive tasks each 10 minutes for free until you get what you need
  - Keep items without finishing them to instantly complete tasks. For example, you can let a building finish but not click in the chest, once you have the building task you can click on the chest and finish the task right away. This can be done with soldiers, building and research tasks.
  - To help your guild do not keep a guild task for too long, if you can't complete instantly or within a reasonable time while you are online do not pick it up. 
  - Personally, I like to complete my daily stuff and complete the tasks without using resources. I keep accelerators and stamina for other events. Just doing that already provides me more than enough to complete individual reward (6000 points), normally I'll have around 15000 points by the end of the race.
  - If you need time to complete a task, try to refresh the exclusive ones until the one you need. The exclusive ones will not block your guild, you can spend any amount of time to complete exclusive tasks.
