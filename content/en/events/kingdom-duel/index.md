Tips:
- The day before this stage, send your troops to gather rubies with time to end the gathering at the start of this stage for a heads up.
- Save Stamina Potions to be used in this day.
- Do not complete the last bounties of the day before right away. Save them to be completed when this stage starts.
- Save the Bounties Stages to be completed this day.
- If you are out of stamina, send troops to collect rubies.
- Focus on initiating rallies on the highest level you can. Killing mobs are not worth it since they will give less points per stamina, even if they are less costly.
- Pet rallies count for this stage points.
- Dark legion rallies **do not** count towards this stage points. Avoid completing them on this day since you want to use any stamina you have to get points on the event.
- Legion treasures **do not** count towards this stage points. 
- Do not heal your troops right away if you can. Let them accumulate and schedule the healing for it to be finished on "Stage 6: Cross-Kingdom Conquest" day.
- Save Refined Metal, Magic Thread and Orichalcum to be used either at this stage or at "Call of the Hero". For me, this stage is easier to get points, so I prefer to upgrade the lord gear with those items at the "Call of the Hero" stage.

#### Stage 4: Call of the Hero

| Quest                                | Score         |

| Use 1 Horde Soul Stone               | 120000 points |
| Use 1 Nature Soul Stone              | 120000 points |

Tips:
- Save Recruitment Tokens and Hero Shards to be used this day.
- Save Refined Metal, Magic Thread and Orichalcum to be used either at this stage or at Global Battles. For me, this stage is harder to get points, so I prefer to upgrade the lord gear with those items at this stage.
- If you can, try to recruit form Tavern when Heroic Armament event is at the "Hero Development" theme, so you can earn more items.

### How It Works (in game description)

#### Overview

1. Kingdom Duel matches two equally powerful servers against each other.
2. The event is divided into two stages: the Preparation stage and the War stage.
3. In the Preparation stage, lords complete tasks to earn points for their server and win rewards. The server with the most points at the end of the stage wins. The server with fewer points loses.
4. In the War stage, lords can invade the enemy server to fight and earn points for killing enemy soldiers. A KvK Throne War will also be held on the losing server, with the winning server capturing the Royal Castle for ultimate victory! 5. If the total server count is odd, some servers might miss matching. These servers can participate in the [Preparation Stage] but won't be part of the [War Stage] during the event.

#### Event Stages

[Matching Stage]
1. The matching stage lasts for 1 day, during which the system pairs two servers with similar strength.

[Preview Stage]
1. The preview stage lasts for 1 day, during which the matching results will be announced and can be viewed in the event panel.

[Preparation Stage]
1. The Preparation Stage spans 5 days, each with a different task theme. Completing these tasks earns points.
2. Points earned contribute to your guild and server. Daily ranking rewards are given based on personal and guild points.
3. The server with the highest points at the end of the Preparation stage wins.

[War Stage]
1. The War Stage lasts for 1 day, allowing lords to invade the opposing server for battle. Even if your castle falls, you remain on the enemy
server.
2. Earn points through kill tasks, which also boost your guild's score. Individual and guild ranking rewards are given at the end of the War Stage.
3. A KvK Throne War takes place on the losing server, with the winning server from
Preparation attacking and the losing server defending.
4. Attackers receive the Ally Effect on the enemy server, preventing friendly fire and allowing them to assist in the Royal Castle battle. Defenders receive the same effect on their server.
5. The KvK Throne War starts at: 2025-01-11 05:00:00 (your timezone), lasts 4 hours.
Capturing the Magic Tower may accelerate the speed of taking the Royal Castle. The server that accumulates 2 hours of capture time wins the Royal Castle. If no server reaches 2 hours, the server holding the Royal Castle at the end is the winner.
6. Within the first 4 hours of the KvK Throne War, you'll receive a free relocation at regular
intervals.
